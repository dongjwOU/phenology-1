* Phenology Scripts

This repository is my attempt to organize some programs and scripts
related to phenology, the study of plant evolution through digital
images. Below you'll find the requirements to make this project useful
for you. All code available here is released under the GPLv3. Feel
free to copy, modify and do whatever you want. Contributions are
welcomed to improve the robustness. In case of problems,
[[https://github.com/schnorr/phenology/issues][report here]].

** Requirements

#+begin_src sh :results output :session :exports both
sudo apt-get install cmake libjpeg-dev r-base
#+end_src

** Cloning, compilation and installation

You might want to customize the =CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX= variable to your
machine. In the example below, this project will be made available in
the =/tmp/phenology/= directory.

#+begin_src sh :results output :session :exports both
git clone https://github.com/schnorr/phenology.git
cd phenology ; mkdir build ; cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/tmp/phenology/ .. ; make install
