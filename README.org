* Phenology Programs and Scripts

This repository is my attempt to organize some programs and scripts
related to phenology, the study of plant evolution through digital
images. Below you'll find the requirements to make this project useful
for you. All code available here is released under the GPLv3. Feel
free to copy, modify and do whatever you want. Contributions are very
welcomed to improve the robustness or anything else you might find
important. In case of problems, [[https://github.com/schnorr/phenology/issues][report here]].

This repository contains the following programs:

+ =pga_hist=: 

+ =pga_palette=:

** Requirements

#+begin_src sh :results output :session :exports both
sudo apt-get install cmake libjpeg-dev r-base
#+end_src

** Cloning, compilation and installation

You might want to customize the =CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX= variable to your
machine. In the example below, this project will be made available in
the =/tmp/phenology/= directory.

#+begin_src sh :results output :session :exports both
git clone https://github.com/schnorr/phenology.git
cd phenology ; mkdir build ; cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/tmp/phenology/ .. ; make install
#+end_src

** Directory Organization and Photo Specifications

*Images*

The digital images have to be in the JPG file format. No other format
is accepted as of now. All of them should have the exactly same size
(=width= per =height=) and be encoded as RGB (with no alpha channel).
organized image base.

*Directories*

Images should be organized in the following directory structure:
=db/year/year_sequence.jpg=, where =db= is the name of the database, it
can be anything you want (or need); =year= is a diretory that will hold
all that year's images; =year_sequence.jpg= is the name of the file: the
year part should be preferably the same as the directory name holding
the file and the sequence is a integer or floating-point number that
indicates the sequence of images within that year. Some examples:

1. This example has four images. We can notice that the image 003 is
   missing, that is okay. You can use this king of sequencing if you
   have one digital photo per day, for instance.
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   db01/2004/2004_001.jpg
   db01/2004/2004_002.jpg
   db01/2004/2004_004.jpg
   db01/2004/2004_005.jpg
   #+END_EXAMPLE

2. This example shows another type of sequencing, using floating-point
   numbers. You can use this to organize multiple photos per day. Note
   that is up to you to give semantics to the sequencing scheme.
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   mybase/2015/2015_1.1.jpg
   mybase/2015/2015_1.2.jpg
   mybase/2015/2015_1.3.jpg
   mybase/2015/2015_2.jpg
   #+END_EXAMPLE

** The mask

You probably need to mask your images. A mask image should be also in
the JPG file format. It should have the exactly same size (=width= per
=height=) as the digital photos of the database, and also be encoded as
RGB (with no alpha channel). The white color selects the regions you
are interested to. Here I provide two examples:

[[./masks/cerrado.jpg]] [[./masks/tky.jpg]]
